# It's Not Too Late Meeting Script 

Welcome to the It’s Not Too Late group of Alcoholics Anonymous. My name is ___________ and I am an alcoholic.  This is an open online meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. We are glad you are all here – especially newcomers!  In order to cut down on disruptions, we ask everyone to mute their mics throughout the meeting unless speaking. Let’s open with the serenity prayer. Please join me while on mute: 

God, grant me the Serenity 
to accept the things I cannot change, 
Courage to change the things I can, 
and Wisdom to know the difference.

AA is a fellowship of people who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. In keeping with our singleness of purpose and our Third Tradition which states that “The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking,” we ask that all who participate confine their discussions to our problem with alcohol. And, most importantly, to the solution.
Now someone will volunteer to read “How it Works” from the A.A. Big Book, which I will share on the screen…     

**Share screen for readers**

# How it Works 

Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. 

Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided, you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps. At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.
Remember that we deal with alcohol – cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power – that One is God. May you find Him now! 

Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon. Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable. 
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, & to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. 
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out. 
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.  

Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.” Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection. 

Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas: 

- (a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. 
- (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. 
- (c) That God could and would if He were sought. 

**Now a friend will read the 12 Traditions**

# The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous

1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity.
2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority... a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants they do not govern. 
3. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. 
4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole. 
5. Each group has but one primary purpose: to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. 
6. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property & prestige divert us from our primary purpose. 
7. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
8. AA should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers. 
9. AA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 
10. AA has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy. 
11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.  
12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.
