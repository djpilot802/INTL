# INTL

# Welcome to the INTL App 

This is where I'll attempt to write an app that automates the process of signups and Timetree for INTL. This will be the first, full app that I've built and I'm excitied of the challenge to get it up and running. 

## Completed 

- Read Signup genius and convert to frame 
- Remove unnecessary values and text errors like signup and slots added 
- Split names into three individuals 
- Started oauth process, but it keeps re-directing endlessly

## Remaining Tasks 

- Get oauth that autorizes successful with Timetree
- Read calendar and events
- Modify signup genius reader to add additional variables
- Write calendar and events
